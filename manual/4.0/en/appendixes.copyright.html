Creative Commons Legal Code
Attribution 3.0 Unported

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN
ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO
WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS
LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW
IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the
      Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
      adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other
      alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or
      performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
      other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or
      adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the
      original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection
      will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this
      License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
      musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of
      the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching")
      will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this
      License.

   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
      such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,
      phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter
      other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by
      reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
      constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is
      included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or
      more other contributions, each constituting separate and
      independent works in themselves, which together are assembled
      into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection
      will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for
      the purposes of this License.

   c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the
      original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate,
      through sale or other transfer of ownership.

   d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or
      entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.

   e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
      work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who
      created the Work or if no individual or entity can be
      identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of
      a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and
      other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in,
      interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
      expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the
      producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the
      sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the
      case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
      broadcast.

   f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under
      the terms of this License including without limitation any
      production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,
      whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including
      digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a
      lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
      dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
      entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or
      without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated
      works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a
      work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving
      or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated
      works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work
      of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-
      dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
      architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
      phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected
      as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or
      circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered
      a literary or artistic work.

   g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under
      this License who has not previously violated the terms of
      this License with respect to the Work, or who has received
      express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
      this License despite a previous violation.

   h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the
      Work and to communicate to the public those public
      recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or
      wireless means or public digital performances; to make
      available to the public Works in such a way that members of
      the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
      individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
      by any means or process and the communication to the public of
      the performances of the Work, including by public digital
      performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
      means including signs, sounds or images.

   i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means
      including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and
      the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work,
      including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in
      digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to
   reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
   arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
   connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or
   other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
   copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
   below:

   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or
      more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated
      in the Collections;

   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
      Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
      reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
      identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
      example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
      translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
      indicate "The original work has been modified.";

   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
      incorporated in Collections; and,

   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

   e. For the avoidance of doubt:

      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
         jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
         through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot
         be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
         collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the
         rights granted under this License;

      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
          jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
          through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can
          be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to
          collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the
          rights granted under this License; and,

      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right
           to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the
           event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting
           society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
           that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
           granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right
to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise
the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
      terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the
      Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
      copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may
      not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
      terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the
      Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
      the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You
      must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
      the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
      Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
      technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability
      of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
      granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
      Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
      Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart
      from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
      License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any
      Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
      Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
      requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
      Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
      Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.

   b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
      Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has
      been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
      notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or
      means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
      (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
      Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
      parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity,
      journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
      copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
      means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of
      the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
      practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
      associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to
      the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
      and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an
      Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
      Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
      Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
      Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be
      implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
      in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
      credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors
      of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
      credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
      for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
      doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section
      for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
      and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
      implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
      sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor
      and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use
      of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
      permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
      Attribution Parties.

   c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as
      may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You
      Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by
      itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must
      not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action
      in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the
      Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in
      those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
      right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
      make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
      mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
      prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
      Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this
      Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable
      national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
      under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
      but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
   LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
   OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF
   THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
   OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
      License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations
      or Collections from You under this License, however, will not
      have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
      entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
      Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
      this License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
      copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor
      reserves the right to release the Work under different license
      terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
      however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
      License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
      be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License
      will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
      stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
      Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
      the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
      granted to You under this License.

   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
      Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
      to You under this License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
      necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived
      and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall
      be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such
      waiver or consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
      the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by
      any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
      from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
      written agreement of the Licensor and You.

   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced,
      in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the
      Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
      Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention
      of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO
      Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal
      Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
      rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
      jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
      enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
      implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable
      national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
      applicable copyright law includes additional rights not
      granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed
      to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
      restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no
warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons
will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any
damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general,
special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection
to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences,
if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor
hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the
Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize
the use by either party of the trademark "Creative Commons" or any
related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior
written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in
compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage
guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made
available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance of
doubt, this trademark restriction does not form part of this
License.
